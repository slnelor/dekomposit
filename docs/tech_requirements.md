# dekomposit - Gain new lexicon -> revise -> repeat. 


## Why?
A usual all-in-one learning vocab service with an unusual approach.
When you learn new words it's good to use several ways, like listening,
reading, speaking, writing. To make it easier, dekomposit
provides you with different tools and methods to learn -
from hand-writing to watching short animations and reading dialogues.


## Features
### 1. Translation
There must be a translator tool which translates user input to the target language.
The translation must be decomposed into pieces for better readability and user experience.
Decomposed pieces are either phrases or single words. Decomposition must preserve idioms,
citations, and phrasal verbs as single pieces.
Translation will have three main sections:
1. Translation
2. Definitions
3. Examples

Users will have an option to choose another translation method (ReversoContext, ChatGPT etc. Next: Method).
Paid Methods are included in Dekomposer Pack (See in next sections), note that not all Methods are paid.

Along the translation there will be a pixel-art picture that is associated with word meaning.
Not all translations will have pictures.

If user's input contains mistakes it is corrected by dekomposer and user can see a corrected version.
 
### 2. Examples
User will have access to example sentences/texts/dialogues etc. for a specific word/phrase/topic (next: unit).
Examples will have three sections:
1. Dialogue that contains the unit
2. Texts that contain the unit (if needed)
3. Sentences with translation that contain the unit

### 3. Vocabulary
User will have a vocabulary storage (next Vocab). Vocab is used to practice new lexicon
via Learning Method (see in next sections). Also dekomposer decides which examples are used
based on your language level and Vocab.

### 4. Learning Method
To practice Vocab dekomposit uses this Learning Method:
1. Memorize the unit/s with translations or associated pictures (units can be grouped by a topic)
2. Start reading text/dialogue with those units (you can listen to it as well). Text/dialogue is decided by
the system randomly.
3. Write examples on your own
4. Repeat for the next portion of units or select an option to practice this portion more
5. Take a challenging test (optional)

System can force the user to write down words in input and on paper as well.

### Today's Pack of Memorizing
It is a feature that generates 10 to 20 new units that are absent from the
user's Vocab. This pack is updated every day at 12:00 AM UTC. The pack's lexicon
topic may vary from current events like New Year, Christmas, Easter etc... but if
there are no important global events then topic may be chosen in two different
ways:
1. Randomly, according to user's Vocab
2. Most important topics that are absent in user's Vocab

Note that the algorithm goes to Current Events first,
if there are no -> Most important topics for your Vocab, if you have enough
vocab (B2-C1) -> Chosen Randomly

### Reading
There will be a section/page in dekomposit service where users can read
books, articles, stories (next Papers) published by the Trusted Authors (See in the next sections).
Users with Dekomposer Pack may add their own Papers that won't be published and will
be stored only in user's Reading Storage.

### Reading Storage
A storage for keeping track of all read Papers and status (like Paper "Harry Potter" - 40% read, Paper N - 12% read)
Users can store their own Papers in their Reading Storage. Reading Storage is never shared across the other users
until user shares his Paper with others.

Note that when a user shares some Papers, only those Papers
will be shared. By shared it is meant getting a link which
will be available to all who have it. Users who have this link
can open the Paper.

### Inline Translator
It is a tool that is present on every Paper of the dekomposit service. It highlights
the units that can be translated into Target Language (see next sections)
by hovering on them. By pressing on the unit, the user sees the translation of the unit.

### Trusted Authors
Trusted Authors are those who can publish Papers globally on the dekomposit Reading
section to make this Paper available for everyone who uses this section/page.

Trusted Authors are chosen by Our Admins. There are no strict rules for choosing
Trusted Authors. Anyone who wants to become an author can write to our support with
a "Trusted Author" subject and we will decide whether to accept you or not.

Example of Trusted Author mail: "Subject: Trusted author

                                Reason: I'd like to publish Harry Potter and some
                                other books."
